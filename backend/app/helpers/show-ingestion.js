    "description": "From Creator/Executive Producer Tim Kring, who imagined NBC's original critically acclaimed 2006 \"Heroes\" series, comes \"Heroes Reborn,\" an epic 13-episode event series that chronicles the lives of ordinary people who discover they possess extraordinary abilities.\r\n\r\nA year ago, a terrorist attack in Odessa, Texas left the city decimated. Blamed for the tragic event, those with extraordinary abilities are in hiding or on the run from those with nefarious motives.\r\n\r\nTwo such vigilantes include Luke (Zachary Levi, \"Chuck\") and Joanne (Judith Shekoni, \"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2\"), who are seeking to avenge a tragic loss.\r\n\r\nNoah Bennet, aka HRG (Jack Coleman, \"Heroes\"), has gone off the grid, but conspiracy theorist Quentin Frady (Henry Zebrowski, \"A to Z\") finds him and opens his eyes to the truth behind the Odessa tragedy.\r\n\r\nWhile in hiding, some are discovering their newfound skills. Awkward teen Tommy (Robbie Kay, \"Once Upon a Time\") just wants to be normal and win the girl of his dreams, Emily (Gatlin Green, \"Criminal Minds\"), but normalcy is virtually impossible after learning of a new ability that terrifies him. Coming from a very sheltered upbringing, a bold and ethereal teenager, Malina (Danika Yarosh, \"Shameless\"), has been told she is destined for greatness. In Tokyo, a quiet and unique young woman, Miko (Kiki Sukezane, \"Death Yankee 3\"), is trying to track down her missing father while hiding an extraordinary secret that will make her a force to be reckoned with. Elsewhere, a different type of hero is emerging through former soldier Carlos (Ryan Guzman, \"The Boy Next Door\").\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Erica (Rya Kihlstedt, \"Masters of Sex\"), the head of the highly successful tech conglomerate Renautas has an agenda of her own.\r\n\r\nFor better or for worse, some are fated to cross paths with assorted heroes of the past, including Hiro Nakamura (Masi Oka), Matt Parkman (Greg Grunberg), Mohinder Suresh (Sendhil Ramamurthy) and the Haitian (Jimmy Jean-Louis), among others. Yet, together, their ultimate destiny is nothing less than saving the world and mankind.\r\n\r\nJoining Kring are Executive Producers James Middleton (\"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles\") and Peter Elkoff (\"Sons of Anarchy\"). \"Heroes Reborn\" is produced by Imperative Entertainment, in association with Universal Television.",

After a series of unfortunate events, Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse are presented with an offer they can't refuse - an apartment at the most prestigious address in the city. Problem is, it comes with a haunted past and an immeasurable price.\r\n\r\nRosemary (Zoe Saldana, \"Avatar,\" \"Star Trek Into Darkness\") and Guy (Patrick J. Adams, \"Suits\") are incredulous at their good fortune and find comfort in a strange city among their new friends and neighbors, the Castevets. This well-to-do successful older couple takes the newcomers under their wing and become very involved with the Woodhouses' lives. Things seem to be perfect as Rosemary becomes pregnant and Guy's career takes off. As their spirited best friend, Guy's co-worker Julie (Christina Cole), spends quality time with Rosemary in the city, she finds Rosemary's health worrying and cautions both of them that something isn't right. Soon there are other signs warning Rosemary to be careful.\r\n\r\nGuy seems to be pulling away from Rosemary and spending a great deal of time hanging around with Roman Castevet (Jason Isaacs, \"Harry Potter\" franchise). Roman's wife, the whimsical Margaux Castevet (Carole Bouquet, \"For Your Eyes Only\"), assures Rosemary her herbs and holistic medicine will help with the pregnancy, but are they helping or hurting? Rosemary's quizzical nature leads her to investigate the building and its past residents. She uncovers a dark past and realizes who Roman Castevet truly is. But is it too late? Are the Castavets' perceived sinister motives legitimate or all in the pregnancy brain of Rosemary?\r\n\r\nIn this new four-hour, two-part psychological thriller written by Scott Abbott (\"Queen of the Damned,\") and James Wong (\"Final Destination 3,\" \"American Horror Story,\" \"The X-Files\") and directed by Agnieszka Holland (\"Europa Europa,\" \"The Wire,\" \"Treme\"), Rosemary quickly finds herself surrounded by peculiar people and startling occurrences. Isolated in her apartment in a city where she doesn't speak the language, she begins to fear the worst: Guy may have made a pact with their neighbors, promising their newborn as a human sacrifice in occult rituals in exchange for a writing career. To what lengths would someone be willing to go for success and fortune?\r\n\r\n\"Rosemary's Baby\" is executive produced by Joshua D.

He is a successful money manager to the stars, living his life in New York with Emma, the sweet woman from Sweden whom he loves and adores. A rare combination of intelligent, funny, kind and beautiful, Emma believes she has finally found her true soul mate. So when she makes the life-changing decision to move back to her native Stockholm to accept a prestigious banking job after being with Bruce for a year, she is surprised and thrilled that he agrees to move with her to begin a new life together.\r\n\r\nMoving halfway around the world with a new love is a huge step. With no job, friends or real clue about what he is getting himself into, Bruce is quick to face the many unique challenges and culture clashes that living in a foreign land presents. The most notable one is how to win over Emma's strange and very Swedish family, starting with her parents, Viveka (Lena Olin, \"Chocolat\") and Birger (Claes Månsson), whom they move in with. Viveka, who is a therapist, dearly loves her family but has difficulty showing it, especially to Emma, and much to Bruce's dismay, she harbors a dislike for him from day one. Birger, a retired sea captain, is a typical Swede - tall, kind and silent. Since his spoken English isn't very sharp, it only adds to the communication barriers.\r\n\r\nEmma's younger brother, Gustav (Christopher Wagelin), is a 28-year old mega-slacker who, for some reason, can do no wrong in his mother's eyes. Bengt (Per Svensson), Birger's younger brother, is an American-adoring rockabilly type who seems to live his life through Hollywood movies.\r\n\r\nAs for Bruce's family, his dad, Wayne (Patrick Duffy, \"Dallas\"), is conservative by nature and resides in a small Midwestern town. Like Wayne, Bruce's adoring mother, Nancy (Illeana Douglas, \"Grace of My Heart\"), wants nothing but the best for her son, but has no understanding whatsoever of his decision to leave his happy life in New York.",

Then there's Joyce (Jenna Elfman, \"Dharma & Greg,\" \"1600 Penn\"), who is your typical teenager - really into fashion, busy with school - but the problem is she's Mom. That makes it difficult for her actual teenage daughter, Katie (Ava Deluca-Verley, \"Southland\"), whose advice (and clothes) Joyce is always seeking. At the center of all this is Henry (Eli Baker), the Fishers' 11-year-old son. Having always been his dad's eyes and wingman, Henry is less than thrilled when his job is outsourced to Mel's new guide dog, Elvis. While the boy is at first reluctant to accept the changes that Elvis brings, adult Henry (voiceover by Jason Bateman, \"Arrested Development,\" \"Identity Thief\") realizes upon reflection that his parents' split finally allowed the Fishers to become one happy (divorced) family.",

As they navigate through life side by side, they can't help but analyze and obsess about everything. From sex and race to anything else your parents told you never to talk about, absolutely no topic is out of bounds for this wildly outspoken group.\r\n\r\nMitch is a college ethics professor, which might explain why he goes through life with a heightened attention to justice. He knows he can't change the world but is quite determined to change his corner of it. At his side is his beautiful wife of five years, Tracy, who by day is a tough-as-nails attorney, and by night a nurturing mom to their four-year-old daughter, Sadie.\r\n\r\nTheir best friends, Russell and Angie, live next door. Russell is Mitch's male voice of reason. A stand-up comic, Russell has absolutely no fear when it comes to talking to someone or making a scene in public to prove his point. His new bride Angie is that spirited, special kind of woman, who while married to a guy that's quite a handful, is able to go toe to toe with him at a moment's notice.\r\n\r\nThese four friends love and support each other so much they can talk about any topic in the most honest, candid and humorous ways. They are the kind of conversations people have with their real friends.\r\n\r\nTruth Be Told is based on the life of DJ Nash, who serves as writer and executive producer.

In this \"Traffic\"-like action drama, an international cover-up explodes when the lives of a female Special Forces soldier, a disillusioned corporate lawyerand a political activist from a privileged family unexpectedly collide\r\n\r\nAfter a team of American soldiers battles jihadists in North Africa, they're shocked to learn that they've stumbled upon and killed Al Qaeda's top commander. Sergeant Odelle Ballard (Anna Friel, \"Pushing Daisies\"), a soldier, mother, wife and the unit's only female member, discovers computer files that prove a major U.S. corporation is funding the jihadists. But before she can tell anyone, her team is attacked and killed. The world is told that the unit was wiped out by enemy militants, but the truth is that Odelle survived and is the only witness to her unit's true assassins: private military contractors - Osela (think \"Blackwater\").\r\n\r\nAs Odelle struggles to survive and find her way home, in New York, former U.S. attorney turned corporate litigator Peter Decker (Peter Facinelli, \"Nurse Jackie\") finds himself embroiled in a merger with the same company that funded the jihadists. As Peter begins to connect the corrupt dots of this company's terrorist involvement, Harrison Walters (Jake Robinson, \"The Carrie Diaries\"), a political activist and trust fund kid, meets a hacker, Bob Offer (Nate Mooney, \"The Riches\"), who claims to have unearthed a massive military-industrial-complex cover-up.

There our nation's greatest thinkers, the über-geniuses working on the next era of scientific achievement, would be able to live and work in a supportive environment.\r\n\r\nThe best architects and planners were commissioned to design a welcoming place for these superlative geniuses to reside, an area that would offer the best education for their children, the best healthcare, the best amenities and quality of life. A community was created to rival the most idyllic of America's small towns— with one major difference: this town would never appear on any maps. At least, none that haven't been classified \"eyes only\" by the Pentagon.\r\n\r\nThus, the town of Eureka was born. But for all its familiar, small-town trappings, things in this secret hamlet are anything but ordinary. The stereotype of the absent-minded professor exists for a reason, and most of the quantum leaps in science and technology during the past 50 years were produced by Eureka's elite researchers. Unfortunately, scientific exploration is rarely what one expects, and years of experiments gone awry have yielded some peculiar by-products.\r\n\r\nWith the population's unique talents, troubled psyches and limitless resources, these small-town concerns have a way of becoming big-time problems.

    "description": "NBC kicks off a new reality competition series \"Fashion Star,\" that will search for the next big brand in fashion. Featuring host and executive producer Elle Macpherson, along with celebrity mentors Jessica Simpson, Nicole Richie and John Varvatos, the series will give 14 unknown designers the chance to win the multi-million dollar prize of launching their collections in three of America's largest retailers: Macy's, H&M and Saks Fifth Avenue. Each week, the show will begin with an exhilarating fashion show unlike anything seen before, featuring musical performances, dancers and models in front of a studio audience. Every fashion show will be built around a weekly challenge that is designed to further develop and expand the designers' brands. The series will feature clothes designed for America to buy and has enlisted three of the world's top retailers to help in the decision making process. Caprice Willard (Macy's), Terron E. Schaefer (Saks Fifth Avenue) and Nicole Christie (H&M) will serve as the judges who make on-the-spot decisions as they vie for the right to purchase and exclusively carry the work of the up-and-coming designers each week. At the end of each episode, America will have the chance to immediately purchase the winning designs showcased on the episode that week. What viewers see on TV that night will be on the streets and in stores immediately. With just a single trip down the runway, \"Fashion Star\" will change the lives and fortunes of these aspiring designers forever.",
