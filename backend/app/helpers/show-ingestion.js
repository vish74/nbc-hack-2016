  //   "description": "From Creator/Executive Producer Tim Kring, who imagined NBC's original critically acclaimed 2006 \"Heroes\" series, comes \"Heroes Reborn,\" an epic 13-episode event series that chronicles the lives of ordinary people who discover they possess extraordinary abilities.\r\n\r\nA year ago, a terrorist attack in Odessa, Texas left the city decimated. Blamed for the tragic event, those with extraordinary abilities are in hiding or on the run from those with nefarious motives.\r\n\r\nTwo such vigilantes include Luke (Zachary Levi, \"Chuck\") and Joanne (Judith Shekoni, \"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2\"), who are seeking to avenge a tragic loss.\r\n\r\nNoah Bennet, aka HRG (Jack Coleman, \"Heroes\"), has gone off the grid, but conspiracy theorist Quentin Frady (Henry Zebrowski, \"A to Z\") finds him and opens his eyes to the truth behind the Odessa tragedy.\r\n\r\nWhile in hiding, some are discovering their newfound skills. Awkward teen Tommy (Robbie Kay, \"Once Upon a Time\") just wants to be normal and win the girl of his dreams, Emily (Gatlin Green, \"Criminal Minds\"), but normalcy is virtually impossible after learning of a new ability that terrifies him. Coming from a very sheltered upbringing, a bold and ethereal teenager, Malina (Danika Yarosh, \"Shameless\"), has been told she is destined for greatness. In Tokyo, a quiet and unique young woman, Miko (Kiki Sukezane, \"Death Yankee 3\"), is trying to track down her missing father while hiding an extraordinary secret that will make her a force to be reckoned with. Elsewhere, a different type of hero is emerging through former soldier Carlos (Ryan Guzman, \"The Boy Next Door\").\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Erica (Rya Kihlstedt, \"Masters of Sex\"), the head of the highly successful tech conglomerate Renautas has an agenda of her own.\r\n\r\nFor better or for worse, some are fated to cross paths with assorted heroes of the past, including Hiro Nakamura (Masi Oka), Matt Parkman (Greg Grunberg), Mohinder Suresh (Sendhil Ramamurthy) and the Haitian (Jimmy Jean-Louis), among others. Yet, together, their ultimate destiny is nothing less than saving the world and mankind.\r\n\r\nJoining Kring are Executive Producers James Middleton (\"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles\") and Peter Elkoff (\"Sons of Anarchy\"). \"Heroes Reborn\" is produced by Imperative Entertainment, in association with Universal Television.",

After a series of unfortunate events, Rosemary and Guy Woodhouse are presented with an offer they can't refuse - an apartment at the most prestigious address in the city. Problem is, it comes with a haunted past and an immeasurable price.\r\n\r\nRosemary (Zoe Saldana, \"Avatar,\" \"Star Trek Into Darkness\") and Guy (Patrick J. Adams, \"Suits\") are incredulous at their good fortune and find comfort in a strange city among their new friends and neighbors, the Castevets. This well-to-do successful older couple takes the newcomers under their wing and become very involved with the Woodhouses' lives. Things seem to be perfect as Rosemary becomes pregnant and Guy's career takes off. As their spirited best friend, Guy's co-worker Julie (Christina Cole), spends quality time with Rosemary in the city, she finds Rosemary's health worrying and cautions both of them that something isn't right. Soon there are other signs warning Rosemary to be careful.\r\n\r\nGuy seems to be pulling away from Rosemary and spending a great deal of time hanging around with Roman Castevet (Jason Isaacs, \"Harry Potter\" franchise). Roman's wife, the whimsical Margaux Castevet (Carole Bouquet, \"For Your Eyes Only\"), assures Rosemary her herbs and holistic medicine will help with the pregnancy, but are they helping or hurting? Rosemary's quizzical nature leads her to investigate the building and its past residents. She uncovers a dark past and realizes who Roman Castevet truly is. But is it too late? Are the Castavets' perceived sinister motives legitimate or all in the pregnancy brain of Rosemary?\r\n\r\nIn this new four-hour, two-part psychological thriller written by Scott Abbott (\"Queen of the Damned,\") and James Wong (\"Final Destination 3,\" \"American Horror Story,\" \"The X-Files\") and directed by Agnieszka Holland (\"Europa Europa,\" \"The Wire,\" \"Treme\"), Rosemary quickly finds herself surrounded by peculiar people and startling occurrences. Isolated in her apartment in a city where she doesn't speak the language, she begins to fear the worst: Guy may have made a pact with their neighbors, promising their newborn as a human sacrifice in occult rituals in exchange for a writing career. To what lengths would someone be willing to go for success and fortune?\r\n\r\n\"Rosemary's Baby\" is executive produced by Joshua D.

In the reality where his wife is alive he is partnered with rookie Efrem Vega (Wilmer Valderrama) and is seeing a confrontational department-recommended psychiatrist Dr. Lee (BD Wong). His wife has redecorated the house and begins pushing him to move in an apparent effort to move past their son's death. In the reality in which his son is alive, Britten maintains his long time partner Isaiah \"Bird\" Freeman (Steve Harris) and sees a more nurturing psychologist, Dr. Evans (Cherry Jones). His son, previously a football player, has recently returned to playing tennis, and is coached by Hannah's former doubles partner Tara (Michaela McManus). Britten remains unsure which of the two realities, if either, is real, and begins to worry he is losing his sanity when details begin to cross over between the two.",

He is a successful money manager to the stars, living his life in New York with Emma, the sweet woman from Sweden whom he loves and adores. A rare combination of intelligent, funny, kind and beautiful, Emma believes she has finally found her true soul mate. So when she makes the life-changing decision to move back to her native Stockholm to accept a prestigious banking job after being with Bruce for a year, she is surprised and thrilled that he agrees to move with her to begin a new life together.\r\n\r\nMoving halfway around the world with a new love is a huge step. With no job, friends or real clue about what he is getting himself into, Bruce is quick to face the many unique challenges and culture clashes that living in a foreign land presents. The most notable one is how to win over Emma's strange and very Swedish family, starting with her parents, Viveka (Lena Olin, \"Chocolat\") and Birger (Claes M√•nsson), whom they move in with. Viveka, who is a therapist, dearly loves her family but has difficulty showing it, especially to Emma, and much to Bruce's dismay, she harbors a dislike for him from day one. Birger, a retired sea captain, is a typical Swede - tall, kind and silent. Since his spoken English isn't very sharp, it only adds to the communication barriers.\r\n\r\nEmma's younger brother, Gustav (Christopher Wagelin), is a 28-year old mega-slacker who, for some reason, can do no wrong in his mother's eyes. Bengt (Per Svensson), Birger's younger brother, is an American-adoring rockabilly type who seems to live his life through Hollywood movies.\r\n\r\nAs for Bruce's family, his dad, Wayne (Patrick Duffy, \"Dallas\"), is conservative by nature and resides in a small Midwestern town. Like Wayne, Bruce's adoring mother, Nancy (Illeana Douglas, \"Grace of My Heart\"), wants nothing but the best for her son, but has no understanding whatsoever of his decision to leave his happy life in New York.",

Unbeknownst to him, both of his parents and his sister are part of a dormant Russian sleeper cell that has just been reactivated.\r\n\r\nYears ago, Russian-born Katya (Hope Davis) was tasked by the KGB to recruit American businessman Mark O'Connor (Scott Cohen) as a spy, and the two fell in love. A deal was struck: as long as Katya remained an asset for Russia, she would be allowed to marry Mark and move to America. After years in America building a happy life and without word from Moscow, they thought they had escaped. Now it seems the new Mother Russia has one more mission - turning Alex into a spy. The SVR (Russian Intelligence) has re-enlisted the entire family into service as they plan a terrorist operation inside U.S. borders that will bring America to its knees. For these anguished parents, the choice is clear: betray their country... or risk their family.\r\n\r\nThe series also stars Margarita Levieva (Natalie O'Connor), Morgan Spector (Victor Dobrynin), Kenneth Choi (Sam Luttrell) and Alex Peters (Sarah O'Connor).\r\n\r\nBased on an Israeli format, \"Allegiance\" is a production of Universal Television, Keshet Media and Yes! and comes from Executive Producer, Showrunner and Producing Director George Nolfi (\"The Adjustment Bureau\") and Executive Producers Avi Nir, John Glenn, Rashad Raisani, Ron Leshem, Amit Cohen, Giyora Yahalom and Yona Wisenthal.",

Each week, the show will begin with an exhilarating fashion show unlike anything seen before, featuring musical performances, dancers and models in front of a studio audience. Every fashion show will be built around a weekly challenge that is designed to further develop and expand the designers' brands. The series will feature clothes designed for America to buy and has enlisted three of the world's top retailers to help in the decision making process. Caprice Willard (Macy's), Terron E.
